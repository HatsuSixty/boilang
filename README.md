# boilang

Simple interpreter implemented in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) just to test the language out properly. It just contains a lexer, a parser and the interpreter itself, however, it can't read from files, you have to change the string built-in to the compiler.

## Quick Start
```console
$ cargo run
```
